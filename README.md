## Specification

**Note: As of this assignment, we will be switching to Python3 officially.**

1. Using a PocketLab in class, take the following set of data:
    * Turn on 2 graphs: 3-axis acceleration, and altitude
    * By holding the device with a rigid orientation (z-axis aligned with vertical - why is this advisable?), take a recorded set of data while moving the device along an interesting path. As a suggestion, try a vertical helix. Be sure to keep your motions smooth, and changing slowly enough that the data points are being sampled fast enough to resolve the acceleration data.
    * Email yourself the dataset, which will arrive as a ```.csv``` file.
1. Read up on the ```pandas``` extension to ```numpy``` [here](http://slides.com/profdressel/numpy-and-pandas-overview). Try out everything in an ```ipython``` interpreter to make sure you understand what is going on. Discuss with your teammates. 
1. Write a python module ```kinematics.py``` that integrates your acceleration data to produce a 3D position trajectory of the device during your experiment. Remember that $\vec{v}(t) = \int \vec{a}(t)dt$ and $\vec{x}(t) = \int \vec{v}(t)dt$ analytically. Explain what you have to do numerically to perform these integrations with the actual collected data.
1. Create a Jupyter notebook ```cw5.ipynb``` that uses ```pandas``` to plot the data sets you have taken using ```matplotlib```. Import ```kinematics.py``` and plot your reconstructed trajectory for the device. Compare the z-component of this trajectory to the collected altitude data. Do they agree? Discuss your findings and conclusions in your notebook.

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.
