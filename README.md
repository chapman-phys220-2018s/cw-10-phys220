# PHYS220 CW 10 

**Author(s):** **Daniel, Myranda, Devon**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2018s/cw-10-phys220.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2018s/cw-10-phys220)

## Specification

1. Go through the example notebook and code with your group. Discuss and make sure you understand what is happening.
1. Create a new module `estimate_e.py`. Using the fact that $\int_0^1 e^x dx = e - 1$, estimate the value of $e$ using a Monte Carlo technique. (Hint: think about how $\pi$ is estimated in the notebook.) Test your implementation using a test module `test_estimate_e.py` that passes with Travis.
1. Complete the exercise at the bottom of the notebook. Be sure to preserve the existing code such that the rest of the notebook still runs unmodified.

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.
