# PHYS220 CW 10 

**Author(s):** **Daniel, Myranda, Devon**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2018s/cw-10-phys220.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2018s/cw-10-phys220)

## Specification

1. Go through the example notebook and code with your group. Discuss and make sure you understand what is happening.
1. Create a new module `estimate_e.py`. Using the fact that $\int_0^1 e^x dx = e - 1$, estimate the value of $e$ using a Monte Carlo technique. (Hint: think about how $\pi$ is estimated in the notebook.) Test your implementation using a test module `test_estimate_e.py` that passes with Travis.
1. Complete the exercise at the bottom of the notebook. Be sure to preserve the existing code such that the rest of the notebook still runs unmodified.

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**This assignment was interesting, but the walkers were a challenge.  One difficulty is that our trial server could not handle more than 300 frames, however, this is also an important lesson because it demonstrates the place of efficiency in coding.  At some point you will hit a wall of computing power or you will just be using more resources than you need to, so it is best to be as efficient as possible. - Daniel**

## Honor Pledge
